# ShadCN Blocks for Svelte

A Svelte port of [ShadCN Blocks](https://www.shadcnblocks.com) by [Rob Austin](https://twitter.com/ausrobdev) — a premium, responsive collection of Tailwind-based UI sections and components originally built for React.

This project brings those beautifully designed blocks to the Svelte ecosystem, making it easy to compose landing pages, layouts, and marketing sites with **ready‑to‑use UI components**.

## Usage

The Svelte block registry is hosted at  
[https://shadcn.mahyarmirrashed.com](https://shadcn.mahyarmirrashed.com)

You can install components directly from the registry using the `shadcn-svelte` CLI:

```sh
npx shadcn-svelte add https://shadcn.mahyarmirrashed.com/r/navbar1
```

Each block comes preconfigured with Tailwind CSS styles and is designed to integrate seamlessly into your Svelte or SvelteKit project.
